# Pyspark-VenmoAnalsis
This project is to use Pyspark as an analytic tool to do Venmo's social network analysis.

The code is written in Colab, Databricks and Jypyter notebook and combined together on Colab.

There maybe some reloading problem when try to reload the Venmo.ipynb, but just keep reloading it will show up in two or three times.
